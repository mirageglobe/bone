Bone is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. I'm always open to contribution. :)

Special Thanks to:
- based on Bones by **Eddie Machado**: http://themble.com/bones
- Paul Irish & the HTML5 Boilerplate
- Yoast for some WP functions & optimization ideas
- Andrew Rogers for code optimization
- David Dellanave for speed & code optimization
- and several other developers. :)
