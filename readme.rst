Bone is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup.
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a
frequent user. This is based on Bones by Eddie Machado http://themble.com/bones

Special Thanks to:

- Eddie Machado
- Paul Irish & the HTML5 Boilerplate
- and several other developers
