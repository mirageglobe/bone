Bone is a singular representation of bones. This work is based on
the great work BONES by Eddie http://themble.com/bones/


*******************************************************************

Remember, once you download Bones it's up to you how to use it,
so go nuts. Set things up and develop in a way that's easiest for
you. If LESS/Sass is still a bit confusing for you, then remove them
and customize this template as you see fit.

If you're frustrated with this new direction and don't like change,
take a few minutes and think about how much better a developer you 
can become by just TRYING out new technologies. It may be tough at 
first but it WILL make you a better developer. TRUST ME ON THIS. Give
it a week, maybe two, and you will never go back.

Happy Developing!
