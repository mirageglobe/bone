Bone is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built using HTML5 with responsive bootstrap (with bootstrap normalise included). It was updated using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup. It now includes fontawesome, bootstrap, jquery by default. It has a carousel which you can disable.
